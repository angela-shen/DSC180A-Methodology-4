1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I think the most interesting topic covered was re-entrant corners. I learned a lot about how SQL works with geospatial data, geospatial data types, how to apply geospatial concepts in order to extract the information you are looking for, etc.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

The main theme of our work so far has been investigating properties of buildings and structures that might increase their wildfire risk, and how to use tools like SQL and data visualization to analyze where there might be areas of higher risk. I think exploring features like re-entrants corners could be a good topic, but the theme is broad enough that a lot of other interesting investigations could fall under the same category.

3. **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One thing I think could have improved the course a bit was that the first couple of weeks were relatively light reading, followed by a much more complex programming task in SQL. While I did enjoy the challenge, it did take longer than I think was expected and I felt there were some steps where a bit more direct guidance could have been useful. Overall I think the reading should have taken fewer weeks and the programming task should have taken a bit longer or included more hints and tips.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

We have mostly been focused on learning to use SQL since it can easily query large tables of data and geospatial data types like polygon, which are extremely useful for analysis and visualization. However, I would also like to learn to use GIS tools and packages in other languages like R and Python.
